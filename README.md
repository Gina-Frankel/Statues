## Why

We created this project to enable people to learn about slavery through examining public art in England. The project seeks to provide information about statues that represent people involved in slavery. Through looking at these people in more detail an understanding about the time-scale of slavery, and the context and values which enabled slavery can be built. Although slavery is abolished pieces of the past still exist today.
