    "Recently a statue of Edward Colston was removed by protestors and sent into the sea.  We had never known there was statue in Bristol of a slave trader. This made us  realise that we walk past all this public art and have no idea about the people they represent and if these celebrated people represent values that we share. We want people to have a deeper understanding of the art that surrounds them,  and have an opportunity to reflect on the values represented by the statue , the artist and if these values have a place in our cultural identity.",
