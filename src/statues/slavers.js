    slaverSummary:
      "William Penn, (1644 -1718) was an English Quaker leader who founded Pennsylvania as a refuge for Quakers and other religious minorities of Europe. Quaker ideology challenged traditional ideas of inequality, which was reflected in Pen’s advocation  of religious and democratic freedom. However these egalitarian  values did not stretch towards slaves. Pen owned and even traded slaves himself. \n\nIt was quite common in that period to find Quakers supporting the slave trade. In later years the Quakers become active abolitionists. This position was not overnight, individual Quakers had to campaign for many years before the rest of the Quaker community followed.  As early as the 1671 slavery was raised as a moral issue when two Quakers visited Barbados. But only in 1727 in the UK and in 1774 in America one could not be a Quaker and own or trade slaves. In the following decades the Quakers would become more active campaigning for abolitionism. Unfortunately in Penn’s time these ideas were not prevalent, and he was not able to see the contradictions in his professions of equalitarianism with his involvement in slavery. ",

      "Adam Sedgwick (1785 – 1873) was a British geologist and priest, one of the founders of modern geology. In 1983 he was awarded half of £3783.1s. 8d.in compensation for 174 slaves. He had never owned slaves but he was a co-trustee for the will of Ann Sill.\n\nAnn Sill was an owner of slaves in plantations in Jamaica. She had claimed compensation, but had then died. The compensation was awarded to her trustees. The Sills were farmers that supplemented their income with the slave trade. There are claims that the Sill’s not only owned slaves in Jamaica but kept slaves in their house in the Yorkshire Dales. In August 1758 an advert was placed in the newspaper where Edmund Sill, Ann’s father, was offering a reward for the location or return of an African slave who had run away. ",

      "William Beckford (1760 -1844) was a famous writer and collector. He inherited one of the greatest individual fortunes in England. \n \nHis wealth was a result of numerous sugar plantations in Jamaica and the forced labour of  more than a 1000 African slaves on these plantations. The families connection with slavery began in 1661 when Peter Beckford, William Beckford’s great grandfather travelled to Jamaica in search of wealth. Here he started to amass political power, land and slaves. On his death he had £1.5. million in the bank, 20 estates and 1200 slaves. His son, also Peter Beckford continued building the plantations and amassing slaves. On his death he was in ownership of 1737 slaves.\n \n Alderman Beckford, the son of Peter Beckford and father of William Beckford strove to raise the social standing of the Beckford family in England. He was involved in politics and was an Alderman and later a Lord Mayer (1762) of London. He used his political power to influence trade and colonial polices. As an absentee planter, he ruled with brutal force. In 1970 there was a slave rebellion. Over 400 slaves were killed and the leader of the rebellion was burnt alive.\n\nWilliam Beckford, was 10 when he inherited all his families legacy including at 1356 slaves. Beckford was minimally involved in the running of the Jamaican plantations. However he was very happy to spent the plantation profits. He used the money on a vast collection of  books, furniture, objects and art; and on building extravagant architecture structures which included Fronthill Abbey, a large Gothic Revival country house and Landown Tower. Following the abolition of slavery in 1838 Beckford received financial compensation, which he used to add to his collection.",

He bought dozens more in the course of his life and obtained more through his marriage. Upon his death he had more than 100 slaves. Washington believed he treated his slaves fairly. However there were occasions were slaves approached Washington to tell them they did not have enough rations, and that they had to supplement their diet with hunting and fishing, they were only given two outfits of clothing per year and they were punished with whipping, and being sold to other plantations. \n\n His views of slavery began to change during the US revolution. He expressed support for the gradual emancipation of slavery. However he never took any action to abolish slavery, and even supported measures passed by Congress to protect slavery. His only practical anti-slavery action come in his will, where he stipulated that all his slaves should be emancipated upon the death of his wife.  She decided to free them before her death and in January 1801,  they were emancipated. ",
